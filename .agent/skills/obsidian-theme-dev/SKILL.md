# Obsidian Theme Development Skill

This skill provides patterns and rules for developing Obsidian themes, focusing on CSS/SCSS development, styling conventions, and theme-specific coding practices.

## Purpose

To ensure consistent theme development, proper CSS organization, and adherence to Obsidian's theming patterns and CSS variable usage.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:

- Writing or modifying CSS/SCSS for `theme.css`

## Core Rules
