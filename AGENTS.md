## Project Metadata

- **Project**: Obsidian Plugin
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Primary Commands**: `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm dev`, `pnpm lint:fix`

## Core Policies

- **CRITICAL**: Never perform automatic git operations. AI agents must not execute `git commit`, `git push`, or any command that automatically stages or commits changes without explicit user approval.

## Terminology

- Use **"properties"** when referring to YAML metadata at the top of Markdown files.
- **"Markdown"** is a proper noun and must always be capitalized.
